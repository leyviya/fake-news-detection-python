Project Description:
In this Python Project, my aim is to develop a machine learning program to identify when a news source may be producing fake news. 
I used a corpus of labelled real and fake articles to build a classifier that can make decisions about information based on the content from the corpus. Our model focuses on identifying sources of fake news, based on multiple articles originating from a source. 
Once a source is labelled as a producer of fake news, we predict that all future articles from the same source are also a producer of fake news.

What development tools that I used in my project:
Python 3.9
Google Collab
Numpy & Pandas (main) and other deep learning libraries
Open source datasets (.csv file)
